Abstract—Time series anomaly detection is important in mod-
ern large-scale systems and is applied in a variety of domains
to analyze and monitor the operation of diverse systems. Unsu-
pervised approaches have received widespread interest, as they
do not require anomaly labels during training, thus avoiding
potentially high costs and having wider applications. Among
these, autoencoders have received extensive attention. They use
reconstruction errors from compressed representations to define
anomaly scores. However, representations learned by autoen-
coders are sensitive to anomalies in training time series, causing
reduced accuracy. We propose a novel encode-then-decompose
paradigm, where we decompose the encoded representation
into stable and auxiliary representations, thereby enhancing
the robustness when training with contaminated time series. In
addition, we propose a novel mutual information based metric
to replace the reconstruction errors for identifying anomalies.
Our proposal demonstrates competitive or state-of-the-art per-
formance on eight commonly used multi- and univariate time
series benchmarks and exhibits robustness to time series with
different contamination ratios.
I. INTRODUCTION
Time-ordered data, known as time series, from a variety
of embedded sensors has become the foundation for the
continuous monitoring and management of large-scale sys-
tems across a variety of domains such as healthcare [70],
finance [4], logistics [78], manufacturing [71], and natural
sciences [33]. Time series anomaly detection, an important
branch of time series analysis, constitutes fundamental func-
tionality in data analytics, data management, and data mining.
Time series anomaly detection is receiving increasing attention
in academia and industry, with numerous applications that
include system maintenance [53], network intrusion moni-
toring [55], and credit card fraud detection [74]. The lack
of labeled data and the diversity of anomalies combine to
make the problem of identifying anomalies challenging and
to limit the applicability of methods that require supervision.
This has spurred research on unsupervised methods, leading
to promising results.
Recent neural network based methods for time series
anomaly detection achieve strong performance on challenging
datasets [26]. These methods are able to learn long-term,
nonlinear temporal relationships in the data, outperforming

existing “shallow” methods based on similarity search [9],
[11], [56] and density-based clustering [14]. Among the neural
network based methods, a commonly used paradigm adopts an
encoder-decoder mechanism, that first compresses time series
into a compact, hidden representation, and then reconstructs
the time series from the hidden representation, as illustrated in
Figure 1(a). This paradigm employs a so-called autoencoder
(AE) [42], which imposes an information bottleneck [1] that
encourages the compact latent representation to capture only
the most representative patterns of the input time series, while
disregarding fluctuations in the time series. Although autoen-
coders achieve impressive accuracy, they face the following
two limitations.

fully clean, i.e., without anomalies, such that the bottleneck
representation captures the most essential, normal patterns.
When the training time series includes anomalies, they may
pollute the bottleneck representation such that it also captures
anomalous patterns, thus adversely affecting anomaly detec-
tion, i.e., causing some anomalies to have small reconstruction

errors. A more robust paradigm that is able to better deal with
contaminated training data is desirable.
Symmetric design of loss functions and anomaly scores:
The Compress-then-Reconstruct paradigm often uses a sym-
metric design of the training loss functions and anomaly
scores, i.e., both rely on reconstruction errors. This works
well if the training data is clean. However, this symmetric
design is problematic when training with contaminated time
series. Specifically, during training, we still aim to minimize
the reconstruction errors between the input time series T and
the reconstructed time series ˆT . If T already includes anoma-
lies, minimizing the training loss drives the autoencoder to
learn a bottleneck representation that also captures anomalous
patterns caused by anomalies. Thus, in the testing phase, the
reconstruction errors for some anomalies may be small and
thus difficult to detect. To conclude, this symmetric design
causes a problem—training with contaminated data reduces
the detection accuracy. This calls for means to avoid this
problem.
To address the two limitations, we propose an Encode-
then-Decompose Anomaly Detection (EDAD) framework. EDAD
employs a novel “Encode-then-Decompose” paradigm with
an asymmetric design of loss functions and anomaly scores,
where effective mutual information based metrics are proposed
to enhance the robustness w.r.t. contaminated training data.
Encode-then-Decompose paradigm: We propose an Encode-
then-Decompose paradigm that aims to improve robustness to
training with contaminated time series data. Instead of using a
single bottleneck representation to capture the information of
input time series, we decompose a single representation into
two—one representing stable patterns and the other represent-
ing auxiliary patterns. This design aims to separate abnormal
patterns in contaminated time series from normal patterns, to
achieve better robustness than the Compress-then-Reconstruct
paradigm.
The proposed decomposition occurs in the latent represen-
tation space, which we call a “deep” decomposition, whereas
existing time series decompositions often work on the time
series themselves, which we refer to as “shallow” decom-
positions [18], [61], [72]. Specifically, deep decomposition
separates the encoded latent representation into two com-
ponents: stable features and auxiliary features. The stable
features capture shared, invariant patterns across the time
series, while the auxiliary features reflect local variations
and noise. Importantly, the latent space–constructed through
attention modules with linear embedding layers–preserves the
original temporal dependencies [79]. The proposed deep de-
composition is achieved by a novel design of shuffle strategies
along the time dimension, i.e., randomly changing the time
order of the elements in learned representations. Consequently,
shuffling the order of data points in this latent space effectively
corresponds to shuffling their order in the original data, albeit
indirectly. More specifically, the features that are insensitive
to shuffling are stable features, whereas the features that are
sensitive to shuffling are auxiliary features. This implies that
stable features exhibit consistent patterns over time and are
not prone to unpredictable fluctuations. In contrast, auxiliary
features are sensitive to temporal order, making them effective
for capturing localized, short-term patterns, and noise in the
time series. This design is fully unsupervised and parameter-
free, thus enabling unsupervised anomaly detection when
training with unlabeled, contaminated time series data.
Asymmetric design of loss functions and anomaly scores:
The proposed Encode-then-Decompose paradigm’s decompo-
sition of time series representations into stable features and
auxiliary features facilitates an asymmetric design. Instead
of using reconstruction errors, we use mutual information as
a novel and important metric when designing the training
loss and computing anomaly scores. During training, we
consider two aspects to guide the framework’s learning. First,
the auxiliary representation Yaux, which represents point-wise
features, is sensitive to shuffling, and the stable representation
Ysta, which represents long-term features such as trend and
seasonalities, is insensitive to the shuffling. Second, the stable
representation, Ysta, and the original hidden representation
before decomposition, Y, have large mutual information. This
is because the stable representation Ysta captures the majority
of the normal patterns in Y according to our definition of
stable. During testing, we use the point-wise mutual informa-
tion between Yaux and Y to obtain anomaly scores because
Yaux captures unexpected variations in time series. If Y
and Yaux have low mutual information, a time series point
is likely to be an anomaly. In summary, the Encode-then-
Decompose paradigm facilitates separation between training
loss and anomaly scores, thus enabling an asymmetric design.
Table I summarizes key differences between the existing
vs. the proposed paradigm. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first study to propose a deep decomposition
paradigm for unsupervised time series anomaly detection
using mutual information. In summary, the contributions of
the paper are as follows. (i) We propose a novel Encode-
then-Decompose paradigm to distinguish between long-term
patterns (stable features) and short-term patterns (auxiliary
features), thus mitigating the negative effects of training on
contaminated data. (ii) We propose a latent space point-wise
mutual information criterion for anomaly detection and form
an asymmetric pipeline with a decomposition framework to
improve robustness. We also introduce a novel loss function to
train the framework using mutual information. (iii) We report
on extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets using
multiple metrics to assess the effectiveness of the proposal and
offer detailed insight into its performance characteristics.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II cov-
ers preliminaries. Section III details the proposal. Section IV
reports on the experimental study, Section V covers related
work, and Section VI concludes.
II. PRELIMINARIES
A. Time Series
A time series T = ⟨s1, s2, . . . , sN⟩is a sequence of N
time-ordered observations, where each observation si ∈RD
is collected at a specific time step. If D = 1, T is univariate.
If D > 1, T is multivariate (or multidimensional).
B. Time Series Anomaly Detection
Given a time series T
= ⟨s1, s2, . . . , sN⟩, we aim at
computing an anomaly score AS(si) for each observation si
such that the higher AS(si) is, the more likely it is that si is
an anomaly. We focus on the unsupervised anomaly detection
problem, as no labels (neither for anomalies nor for normal
data) are used during training. This follows the definition
of “unsupervised” commonly adopted in prior studies [26],
[58], [75]. In contrast, semi-supervised anomaly detection
assumes access to a small number of labeled normal and/or
anomalous instances, which is not the case in our work.
Further, we make no assumptions about whether anomalies
are point or collective anomalies. If the anomaly scores of
continuous observations are high, these observations can be
considered as a collective anomaly. As discussed in Section I,
in the Compress-then-Reconstruct paradigm, reconstruction
errors are used as anomaly scores; in the proposed Encode-
then-Decompose paradigm, latent space point-wise mutual
information between an encoded representation and auxiliary
features is used for defining anomaly scores, which we will
detail in Section III.
C. Mutual Information Estimation for High-Dimensional Data
Mutual information (MI) measures the statistical depen-
dency between random variables. Formally, given random
variables X and Y , the MI between X and Y , denoted as
I(X, Y ), is defined as follows.
I(X, Y ) =
X
x∈X
X
y∈Y
P(x, y) log
 P(x, y)
P(x)P(y)

(1)
Here, P(x, y) indicate the joint distribution, and P(x) and P(y)
are the marginal distributions of X and Y obtained through
a marginalization process. Note that in the context of time
series, both X and Y are continuous variables.
Conceptually, MI quantifies the amount of shared infor-
mation between a pair of random variables, which measures
the uncertainty in one variable if the knowledge of the other
variable is provided, and vice versa. In other words, the
higher the MI value is, the more information the two random
variables share—knowing one random variable thus reduces
the uncertainty of the other random variable to a large extent.
In contrast, if random variables X and Y are independent,
they do not share any information, and knowing one random
variable does not reduce the uncertainty of the other random
variable, thus making their MI equal to 0.
In this paper, we need to compute the mutual information
between timestamps of time series in a latent space. Gen-
erally, the representation of timestamps in the latent space
can be considered as a high-dimensional vector. Classical
mutual information estimation methods are intractable for such
vectors [30]. The estimation of mutual information on large-
scale data or high-dimensional variables remains challenging.
With the recent advances in mutual information estima-
tion, accurate estimators of mutual information between high-
dimensional variables are available. By introducing variational
bounds and inequalities, the problem of directly estimating
density ratios has been transformed into estimating an opti-
mization problem.
Specifically, we can use the following unnormalized version
of the Barber and Agakov approximation IUBA(X, Y ) to
approximate the mutual information I(X, Y ) between random
variables X and Y [52].
IUBA(X, Y ) ≜Ep(x,y)[log q(x|y)] + h(X)
= Ep(x,y)[log p(x) −log Z(y) + f(x, y)] + h(X)
= Ep(x,y)[f(x, y)] −Ep(y)[log Z(y)]
(2)
Here, h(X) = −Ep(x) [log(p(x))] is the differential entropy of
X, Z(y) = Ep(x)

ef(x,y)
, and q(x|y) denotes the conditional
probability of X given Y , which is defined as follows.
q(x|y) = p(x)
Z(y)ef(x,y)
(3)
Here, q(x|y) is considered as an energy function in sys-
tem [13], ef(x,y) is a tilting function, f(x, y) : X ×Y →R is a
critic function aiming to distinguish whether the x and y come
from the same joint distribution, and Z(y) is the associated
partition function.
If we use different techniques to deal with the factor in
Equation 2, we get a variety of different variational mu-
tual information estimators, including MINE [7], NWJ [7],
InfoNCE [66], and JSD [22].
III. METHODOLOGY
We first present an overview of the Encode-then-Decompose
Anomaly Detection (EDAD) framework that efficiently de-
composes a learned hidden time series representation into
stable and auxiliary representations. Next, we present the
objective function, which is based on representation closeness
and mutual information. This function aims to enable robust
training, to contend settings with contaminated training data.
A. Framework Overview
An overview of the framework is shown in Figure 2. The
proposed framework consists of two stages, covering offline
training and online detection. In the offline training stage, the
model training is performed on time series datasets that may

already include anomalies. In the online detection stage, the
trained model is used for detecting anomalies.
The data preprocessing component is shared by the offline
training and online detection. This component adopts an
established technique [25], [58] and applies the dimension
independence strategy, which is the state-of-the-art method for
time series [79]. This strategy assumes that the dimensions of
a time series do not share information. Thus, it disregards
correlations between dimensions. When applying the dimen-
sion independence strategy, the model is forced to capture
long-term temporal dependencies within each channel and
preventing it from trivially inferring a variable’s value based
solely on other channels. Prior studies [38], [45] have also
reported that the independence-channel setting usually outper-
forms cross-channel modeling. In other words, the dimension
independence strategy can be considered as a consolidation
and temporal augmentation method. We apply the dimension
independence strategy as follows. A multivariate time series
T
∈RN×D is treated as D univariate time series Tj ∈
RN×1, j = 1, 2, . . . , D. The univariate time series are each
standardized and partitioned into overlapping subsequences
by using a sliding window of length B. Then, the resulting
sequences of length B, are fed into the model for training.
Here, we propose EDAD, which is explained in the following
parts. After training, the learned models are then employed
for online anomaly detection. Specifically, each sequence is
preprocessed by the data preprocessing component and then
fed into the trained EDAD model that outputs an anomaly score
for each observation in the series.
B. Network Architecture
We propose a novel encoder-decomposer based architecture
as the backbone of the EDAD framework, as illustrated in
Figure 3.
The framework comprises two components—an encoder
and a decomposer. The encoder encompasses an attention
module. The decomposer encompasses two modules— stable
feature module and auxiliary feature module. The preprocessed
time series are input into a normalizing layer to perform
instance normalization [65], defined as follows.
Ht:t+B = st:t+B −E[st:t+B]
p
Var[st:t+B] + ϵ
· γ1 + β1
(4)
Here, the γ1 and β1 are learnable parameter vectors, and
E[st:t+B] and Var[st:t+B] are the expectation and variance
of a time series subsequences, respectively. The output of
Equation 4 for st:t+B is Ht:t+B. However, for simplicity, we
omit t : t + B in the following.
1) Attention Module: The reason for using attention mech-
anisms is twofold. First, attention mechanisms offer high
parallelism and the ability to capture long-range dependencies.
Second, in contrast to AE with compression mechanisms, we
aim to learn fine-grained representations for each timestamp
without any compression along the time dimension. The output
of the normalization layer is then fed to a linear embedding
layer in the attention module, resulting in the projected vectors
Hemb ∈Rd.
Hemb = Wemb · H
(5)
Here, Wemb is the weight matrix of the linear embedding layer.
Subsequently, self-attention operations are performed as
follows.
Q = WQ · Hemb
K = WK · Hemb
V = WV · Hemb
S = softmax
Q · K⊤
√
d

Y1 = S · V
(6)
Here, WQ ∈Rd×d, WK ∈Rd×d, and WV ∈Rd×d are
projection matrices for query, key, and value, respectively.
In the specific implementation, we employ a multi-head self-
attention mechanism, assuming a total of M heads producing
M outputs [Y1
1, . . . , YM
1 ], where each attention head operates
in a
d
M dimensional space. Then, the outputs of the M
attention heads are concatenated and projected with a linear
transformation, as shown in Equation 7.
Y1 = Wmult · [Y1
1, . . . , YM
1 ]⊤
(7)
Here, Wmult is a learnable parameter to conduct the linear
transformation.
The output of multi-head self-attention is then fed to an ad-
dition and normalization layer to conduct a residual connection
and normalization as shown in Equation 8.
Y2 = Y1 +
Y1 −E[Y1]
p
Var[Y1] + ϵ
· γ2 + β2
(8)
Here, the γ2 and β2 are learnable parameter vectors, E[Y1]
and Var[Y1] are the expectation and variance of matrix Y1.
The output of the addition and normalizing layer is fed to
a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to conduct a sequence of k
linear transformations. We use an MLP with two linear layers
and the ReLU activation function.
Y3 = W2 · ReLU(W1 · Y2)
(9)
Here, W1 and W2 are the learnable weight matrices of the
MLP. Finally, the output Y3 of the MLP is fed into the second

addition and normalization layer, where the computation is
similar to that in the first addition and normalization layer, to
obtain Y (see Equation 8).
2) Stable and Auxiliary Feature Modules: The output of the
attention module, Y, is partitioned into two parts, and each
part is fed into one of the two modules–the stable feature
module and the auxiliary feature module. Stable features
capture shared, invariant information across the time series,
while auxiliary features capture local variations and noise.
Figure 3(c) shows these two modules.
More specifically, Y = [Ysta, Yaux], where Ysta ∈RB× d
2
and Yaux ∈RB× d
2 represent the separated representations that
will be fed into the stable and auxiliary modules, respectively.
To facilitate the model’s effective learning of these two
representations, we have designed both the stable feature
module and the auxiliary feature module. The stable features
of a time series are the features that span many time steps
to represent long-term patterns of the time series. In contrast,
the auxiliary features of a time series are the features that
only span a few time steps to represent short-term patterns or
changes in individual observations of the time series.
To be able to distinguish between stable features and the
auxiliary features, we first define two operations—a shuffle
operation and an identity operation, which are used in both
modules. The shuffle operation, shuffle(·), performs random
shuffling along the time dimension. The identity operation,
identity(·), represents no change to the input. The shuffle
operation is applied along the time dimension within each
subsequence window, while all feature dimensions are treated
separately. This ensures that the temporal order of data points
is manipulated, allowing us to distinguish between stable fea-
tures (insensitive to shuffling) and auxiliary features (sensitive
to shuffling). We proceed to elaborate on the auxiliary module
and the stable module.
Auxiliary Module: In the auxiliary module, we apply an iden-
tity operation to Ysta and perform a shuffle operation on Yaux.
Since the auxiliary features contain information related to
specific timestamps, the shuffling of auxiliary features affects
the final output sequence. Thus, we apply a shuffle operation
to the input feature Y, and the auxiliary features Yaux to
maintain consistency. By doing so, we aim to emphasize that
the auxiliary features are strongly affected by shuffling because
auxiliary features are associated with individual data points.
When we modify the order of data points, we emphasize
the prominent features of every single data point. Due to the
complementary nature of stable features and auxiliary features,
we concatenate the two types of features and project the
concatenated feature space back to the original latent space.
This way, Yaux can capture rapidly changing features.
YI
sta = identity(Ysta)
YS
aux = shuffle(Yaux)
ˆYaux = concat(YI
sta, YS
aux) · Wp
(10)
Then, we formulate the auxiliary loss that measures the
closeness between the two representations, as follows.
Laux = ∥shuffle(Y) −ˆYaux∥2
F
(11)
Stable Module: By definition, stable features remain relatively
stable over a long period. Therefore a random perturbation
of the stable features at a particular timestamp i, denoted
as YS
sta,i, should be interchangeable with its pre-perturbation
stable feature Ysta,i. Therefore, in the stable feature module,
we only shuffle Ysta while keeping Yaux unchanged. By doing
this, we aim to emphasize that the stable features are persistent
and cannot be changed by shuffling because they are contained
5
in long sequences. Finally, after concatenating these two types
of features, we apply a projection to obtain the projected
representation ˆYsta.
YS
sta = shuffle(Ysta)
YI
aux = identity(Yaux)
ˆYsta = concat(YS
sta, YI
aux) · Wp
(12)
The stable feature module lacks the self-supervisory in-
formation (i.e., shuffle) compared to the auxiliary module,
which considers the shuffled Y as self-supervisory informa-
tion. Using a loss function like the one used in the auxiliary
module (Equation 11) makes it susceptible to learning a
trivial solution that simply copies Y, resulting in meaningless
stable features. To avoid this issue, we follow the infomax
principle [8], to maximize the mutual information between the
input and output. Specifically, Ysta contains the normal modes
of Y, so they should have a substantial amount of shared
information. We then incorporate the training process of the
mutual information estimator into the stable feature module
to advocate maximizing the mutual information between Y
and Ysta, denoted as Iθ(Y, Ysta). The final loss of the stable
feature module is then defined as shown in Equation 13.
Lsta = ∥Y −ˆYsta∥2
F −Iθ(Y, Ysta)
(13)
Here, Iθ(·) is the mutual information estimator parameterized
by θ. We can choose a specific estimator among many existing
ones. We choose InfoNCE as defined in Equation 14 as the
default estimator due to its excellent performance as reported
in recent studies [7], [22]. Later, we compare it empirically
with other estimators (see Section IV-C2).
IInfoNCE = EP(Y,Ysta)[fθ(Y, Ysta)]−EP(Ysta)[EP(Y)[efθ(Y,Ysta)]]
(14)
Here, fθ(Y, Ysta) is separable critic function defined as shown
in Equation 15.
fθ(Y, Ysta) = ϕθ(Y)⊤ϕθ(Ysta),
(15)
where ϕθ(·) is a non-linear transformation function such as a
feed-forward neural network.
By proposing the loss function in Equation 13, we aim to
achieve three targets. First, the MI measures the statistical
dependency between latent representations and input data,
offering greater robustness to the separation of the stable
features from the original embedded features. Reconstruction
error primarily captures point-wise deviations between input
and output, which can be unreliable when anomalies are par-
tially reconstructed–especially in the presence of contaminated
training data. The MI can avoid the stable features converging
into the contamination representation by also considering the
number of observations. Because the number of anomalies is
small, the anomalies even with large magnitudes cannot affect
the MI severely. In this case, Ysta encodes stable features of the
time series, and short-term anomalies are less likely to distort
this distribution. Second, this can be seen as introducing the
maximization of MI into representation learning, a principle
used widely [8], [22]. This approach effectively prevents
the model from learning trivial features. Third, it adds the
critic function fθ(·) into the training process. This function
is considered as a contrastive loss to provide self-supervisory
information to the loss.
C. Regularization
We observe that both the stable and auxiliary feature mod-
ules are parameterized. Further, both modules are fed the
output of the encoder, i.e., the stable features and auxiliary
features. As a result, both modules share the parameters of
the encoder for learning. However, these two types of features
represent approximately orthogonal objectives, which can eas-
ily lead to conflicting parameter updates [51]. We address this
challenge by introducing a teacher–student architecture that
serves as a form of consistency regularization [32]. This design
encourages the shared encoder parameters to evolve more
smoothly and coherently, despite the presence of competing
learning signals. Figure 4 illustrates the regularization process.
Specifically, we make two copies of EDAD, where the decom-
poser is disabled and only the encoder is enabled, to serve
as a teacher model and a student model. The student model
is updated directly via gradient descent and is responsible for
learning from the data at each training step [54]. In contrast,
the teacher model maintains an exponential moving average of
the student’s parameters [59]. This design provides a smoother
and more stable representation space that reduces the variance
introduced by frequent student updates, thereby improving the
reliability of mutual information estimation. We use ω and
ψ to represent the parameters of the student model and the
teacher model, respectively. When computing the consistency
regularization, we directly obtain the projected representation
from the output representation of the encoder Y′ through the
projection matrix Wp. The consistency regularization for the
student model and the teacher model is computed as shown
in Equation 16.
Lreg = ∥Y′
ω · Wp −Y′
ψ · Wp∥2
F
(16)
Here, Y′
ω represents the output representation of the student
model, and Y′
ψ represents the output representation of the
teacher model. This way, EDAD is enabled to utilize highly
shared weights to partition the features of the time series
into two parts, thereby increasing the robustness of the model
training.
D. Objective Function
The overall loss is the weighted sum of the auxiliary
reconstruction loss (Equation 11), the stable reconstruction
loss (Equation 13), and the regularization (Equation 16).
L = λ1 · Lsta + λ2 · Laux + λ3 · Lreg
(17)
Hyperparameters λ1, λ2, and λ3 control the trade-off between
the objective function terms. We investigate the sensitivity to
λ1, λ2, and λ3 in the experimental study.

E. Anomaly Scores
We have shaped EDAD to enforce it on learning the stable
features by augmenting the stable feature learning with the
MI module. The remaining information related to individual
observations and short-term patterns is maintained in the
auxiliary features. Therefore, the shared information between
the original features Y and the auxiliary features Yaux can
be used to identify anomalies, which are also related to
individual observations and short-term patterns. This enables
an “asymmetric” design of the loss function used for training
and the definition of anomaly scores.
Given a time series subsequence, we can calculate an
anomaly score as the point-wise mutual information between
its encoded representation Y and the corresponding auxiliary
representation Yaux.
Due to the choice of different mutual information esti-
mators, the critic function fθ(·) (see Equation 13) may not
necessarily be proportional to
P(Y, Yaux)
P(Y)P(Yaux) when tightening
the lower bound [63], so it cannot be used alone to compute the
anomaly scores. Therefore, we employ the entire estimator’s
forward pass. Let Iθ be the mutual information estimator
parameterized by θ. Then, we can compute the anomaly score
for each data point si as follows.
AS(si) = −Iθ(Y, Yaux)
(18)
A high score indicates that the input Y and Yaux share less
information. Since Yaux includes only short-term variations,
si is more likely to be anomalous.
IV. EXPERIMENTS
A. Experimental Settings
1) Datasets: We conduct experiments on eight real-world
datasets that span a wide range of domains, such as manu-
facturing, natural sciences, and healthcare: (1) Pooled Server
Metrics (PSM) [2] is collected from EBAY servers and
records the server monitoring metrics; (2) Soil Moisture Active
Passive (SMAP) [23] is collected by NASA and presents
soil samples and telemetry information from the Mars explo-
ration project; (3) Secure Water Treatment (SWAT) [41] is
collected from a water treatment process in an infrastructure
for research on cyber-security; (4) Mars Science Laboratory
(MSL) [31] is collected by NASA and shows the state of
the sensors in the Mars exploration project; (5) NIPSTS-
SWAN (SWAN) [31] is extracted from solar photospheric
vector magnetograms in Spaceweather HMI Active Region
Patch series; (6) KDD21 [47] is a composite dataset released
for a SIGKDD 2021 competition; (7) Numenta Anomaly
Benchmark (NAB) [3] comprises labeled time series data from
diverse sources, encompassing AWS server metrics, online
ad click rates, real-time traffic data, and Twitter mentions of
major publicly traded firms; (8) Supraventricular Arrhythmia
Database (SVDB) [43] includes 78 half-hour ECG recordings
that supplement supraventricular arrhythmias in the MIT-BIH
Arrhythmia Database. The eight datasets encompass both
multivariate and univariate time series. We acknowledge that
datasets such as SWaT, SMAP, and MSL have known lim-
itations, including high anomaly density, inconsistent labels,
long anomaly windows, and unrealistic distributions. These
issues are discussed in TimeSeAD [68]. Nevertheless, these
datasets are widely used in the time-series anomaly detection
literature, which motivated our decision to include them in
our experiments. We provide statistical information on the
experimental datasets in Table II, including the dimensionality
of each dataset, its length, and the proportion of anomalies.
2) Baselines: We compare EDAD with thirteen strong and
well-known anomaly detection methods. To be comprehensive,
we include neural network based anomaly detection methods
as well as traditional anomaly detection methods with good
performance and published in top venues. Specifically, we
include eleven methods: (1) OC-SVM [60] learns a boundary
that encompasses the normal data while leaving anomalies
outside the boundary; (2) IForest [37] uses an ensemble of
isolation trees to detect anomalies; (3) DAGMM [82] integrates a
GMM and AE to model the distribution of multidimensional data;
(4) Series2Graph [10] is an anomaly detection algorithm that
transforms time series into graph structures; (5) SAND [12]
is an anomaly detection algorithm designed for streaming
data. It identifies anomalous patterns by clustering input data
sequences; (6) LSTM-AD [23] uses RNNs to detect anomalies
by forecasting over long sequences of data; (7) MAD-GAN [34]
employs GAN to recognize anomalies by reconstructing test-
ing samples from the latent space; (8) TranAD [64] utilizes
transformer models to infer anomalies by considering broader
temporal trends in the data; (9) GDN [19] integrates GNNs
and meta-learning with past and recent information to enable
anomaly detection; (10) OmniAnomaly [58] integrates GRUs
and VAEs to learn robust representations of time series data;
(11) IMdiffusion [16] combines time series imputation and
diffusion models to achieve robust anomaly detection. (12)
AnomalyTrans [76] models prior associations and series
associations to capture the association discrepancies; (13)
DCdetector [77] detects time series anomalies using robust
representations based on contrastive learning. Note that we use
the publicly available implementations from the authors of the
above methods.
3) Metrics: We use standard metrics for anomaly detection,
including Precision (P), Recall (R), F1-score (F1), Area Under
the Precision-Recall Curve (A-PR), and Area Under the Re-
ceiver Operating Characteristic Curve (A-ROC) [36]. In addi-
tion, we report Volume-under-the-Surface of Precision-Recall

Characteristic (V-ROC) [46] to alleviate bias stemming from
threshold selections and provide an alternative evaluation per-
spective on anomaly detection methods, utilizing continuous
buffer regions [47]. Each metric offers valuable information.
4) Implementation Details: We implement the proposed
framework and baselines by utilizing PyTorch [49] and Scikit-
learn 0.24 [50] in Python 3.10. All experiments were executed
on a cluster server, which runs Linux Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS. The
server is equipped with an NVIDIA Tesla-A800 GPU with two
64-core AMD CPUs and 512 GiB RAM. The source code is
available at https://github.com/zhangbububu/EDAD/.
5) Hyperparameter Settings: Following recent studies [64],
[76], [77], the dimensionality d of the hidden layer is set to
256, the number of encoder layers is set to 3, the number
of heads M in the multi-head attention is set to 8, and the
window of the input model B is set to 100. By doing this we
ensure a similar backbone and the fairness of comparison. We
set the anomaly ratio to 1% so that the 1% of the data points
with the highest anomaly scores are anomalies [76]. We use the
InfoNCE [66] with separable critics as the mutual information
estimator. In addition, we use the Adam optimizer [29] with
a learning rate of 5 × 10−4 for model training. Early stopping
is adopted in the training process.
To tune λ1, λ2, and λ3, we vary each of λ1, λ2, and λ3
among 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, and 3. After getting the results for
all combinations of λ1, λ2, and λ3, we identify the median
result and use the corresponding hyperparameter setting as the
default setting. We do not use the best result because, in unsu-
pervised settings, we have no labeled data to enable identifying
the best result. Further, we conduct experiments to study the
sensitivity of different λ1, λ2, and λ3 in Section IV-C7. To
do so, we vary a chosen hyperparameter in its range while
fixing the other hyperparameters to their default values. We
also study the effect of window size B in Section IV-C8.
For the other baselines, we use the hyperparameter settings
recommended in existing studies if provided. Otherwise, we
randomly vary parameters in specific methods, such as the
kernel degree in OC-SVM. Then, we report the median of
multiple runs using different hyperparameters.
B. Experimental Results
1) Overall results: We report on the performance of the
proposed EDAD and the baselines on all datasets in terms
of all metrics—see Table III. We also report average results
(see AVERAGE). The top 3 best results for each metric are
highlighted in blue. We observe that the proposed framework
achieves the top 3 highest accuracies on most datasets. Ac-
cording to the average results, EDAD achieves the highest P,
R, F1, V-PR, and V-ROC, and it achieves the top 3 highest
A-PR and A-ROC. This indicates the strong performance of
EDAD as well as significant improvements of EDAD over the
baselines.
To justify whether the accuracy improvements of the pro-
posed methods EDAD over the baselines are statistically signifi-
cant, we conduct t-tests to test the significance of the proposed
methods against baselines. We consider a null hypothesis
H0 that the mean of the anomaly scores of our methods is
similar to the mean of the anomaly scores of baselines, and an
alternative hypothesis H1 that the mean of the anomaly scores
of our methods is different from the mean of the anomaly
scores of baselines. After performing the t-test, we get a p-
value, which is smaller than 0.001. This shows strong evidence
to reject the null hypothesis H0, which in turn suggests that
our models have statistically outperformed baselines.
Finally, we acknowledge that it is unrealistic for a single
method to be able to outperform all other methods across all
datasets and metrics. In other words, there is no one-size-
fits-all solution. Thus, it is unrealistic to expect our proposed
method EDAD to outperform all baselines in all 56 testing
cases (8 datasets × 7 metrics). Among the 56 cases and when
compared to 11 other methods, the proposed EDAD is best in 26
cases, and second-best in 9 cases, as shown in Table IV. The
state-of-the-art method DCdetector is best in only 2 cases
and 2nd best in 18 cases. The Compress-the-Reconstruct based
method LSTM-AD is best in 5 cases and 2nd best in 2 cases.
This clearly shows that EDAD achieves superior performance.
C. Ablation Study
1) Effect of Components: We proceed to assess the effec-
tiveness of each individual module in EDAD. For brevity, we
only report average results over the eight datasets, as shown
in Table V. The results show that EDAD achieves the top 3
highest accuracy when all modules are fully incorporated.
If we only include a single feature module, the model with
the auxiliary feature module (w/o stable feature module)
can yield a better average accuracy when compared to the
counterpart with the stable feature module. This suggests that
the inclusion of the auxiliary feature, serving as an indicator
for calculating anomaly scores, improves EDAD’s performance.
The regularization is less important than the stable feature
and the auxiliary feature modules. However, integrating the
regularization into EDAD can improve the performance further.
In summary, the empirical findings underscore the importance
of each module in EDAD.
2) Effect of Mutual Information Estimators: We study the
effect of different mutual information estimators. This exper-
iment aims to characterize accurately the quality of a specific
mutual information estimator, which, in turn, facilitates the
accurate detection of outliers. Table V compares our default es-
timator InfoNCE and the state-of-the-art estimators NWJ [44],
MINE [7], and JSD [52]. The results show that InfoNCE

performs best, slightly ahead of JSD. This is because both
estimators are part of the contrastive variational bounds family
and treat mutual information estimation as a classification task-
distinguishing joint samples from marginal ones. InfoNCE is
a special case of JSD under a specific contrastive loss, and
both optimize similar objectives with different bias–variance
trade-offs. While their empirical performance is often compa-
rable, JSD tends to be more sensitive to hyperparameters and
initialization, which may affect its robustness. In addition, NWJ
and MINE can also suffer from instability due to their reliance

3) Effect of Critic Functions: While the estimators of
mutual information are crucial in EDAD, there is still a sig-
nificant interaction between the critic function fθ(·) and the
estimators. The design of the critic function determines its
ability to distinguish between joint and marginal distributions.
In the next experiment, we consider three commonly used
critic functions, including bilinear critics [52], concatenated
critics [22], and separable critics [5]. Bilinear critics employ
a bilinear function. Concatenated critics combine different
inputs and employ a neural network to process them. Separable
critics process input data in a separable manner, thus reducing
computational complexity. Table V compares our default sepa-
rable critic function and the two other critic functions, finding
that the default separable critics perform the best. This result
aligns with findings in the literature [63].
4) Contamination Robustness: We aim to evaluate the
robustness of a method at different levels of contamination.
To enable this experiment, we modify a proportion of the
original observations and consider the modified observations
as anomalies [21], [24]. We vary the anomaly ratio among
1%, 2%, 4%, 6%, 8%, 10%, and 20%. For brevity, we
conduct experiments on two datasets: SWAT and SVDB, and
we compare EDAD with two methods: 1) LSTM-AE, which
is a reconstruction-based method employing a Compress-
then-Reconstruct paradigm, and 2) DCdetector, which is
a robust anomaly detection method. We acknowledge that
injected anomalies may not fully reflect the complexity of

noise found in real-world contaminated data. However, they
still serve as a useful proxy for evaluating the robustness of
anomaly detection methods. Figure 5 shows the experimental
results. We observe that DCdetector performs well with a
competitive result due to its ability to learn robust represen-
tations by using contrastive learning. However, DCdetector
achieves an inferior performance to EDAD. This demonstrates
that DCdetector is less robust than EDAD. The results show
that EDAD outperforms LSTM-AE w.r.t. all metrics. When the
contamination ratio increases, EDAD maintains good perfor-
mance w.r.t. all metrics. In contrast, LSTM-AE tends to exhibit
serious drops in performance. This suggests that EDAD is
able to work on contaminated data with performance that is
insensitive to the level of contamination.
5) Runtime Analysis: To study the deployment potential
of EDAD, we compare its runtime (i.e., online detection time)
with two methods in previous experiments: DCdetector and
LSTM-AD. First, we determine the runtime on each dataset.
Then, we report the average runtime over all datasets. To
achieve fair comparisons, we keep the dimensionality of the
hidden states d the same across the methods. We also observe
that the runtime mainly comes from the offline training time.
Table VI reports the time needed (in minutes) to finish one
training epoch. The highest results are highlighted with bold
text.
The training time results show that EDAD performs the
fastest, whereas DCdetector runs much slower. This is be-
cause DCdetector has a dual attention component whereas
EDAD employs only a single attention. Further, the results show
that EDAD is able to train in a very short time. The online
detection time of EDAD is small, i.e., less than 0.1 second,
making it applicable to online anomaly detection in streaming
settings.
6) Memory Analysis: We study the memory consumption
of EDAD and compare it with the memory consumption of two
methods in previous experiments: DCdetector and LSTM-AD.
First, we determine the memory consumption on each dataset.
Then, we report the average memory consumption over all
datasets. To achieve fair comparisons, we keep the dimen-
sionality of the hidden states d the same across the methods.
Table VII shows the RAM (in GB) used by the methods for
training. The best results are highlighted with bold text.

Figure 7: Effect of B.
We observe that EDAD consumes the least memory in most
cases except the case d = 128, and DCdetector consumes
the most memory. This is because DCdetector has a dual
attention component whereas EDAD only uses single attention.
This suggests that EDAD is able to perform on low-cost off-
the-shelf computers. This enables the use of EDAD in many
different resource-limited environments.
7) Effect of λ1, λ2, and λ3: We study the sensitivity of the
hyperparameters λ1, λ2, and λ3 in the objective function of
EDAD (see Eq. 25). Specifically, we vary one λ among 0.1, 0.5,
1, 2, and 3 while keeping the other two fixed at 1 to investigate
the sensitivity to the hyper-parameter. Figure 6 shows the
results. First, λ3 controls the strength of the regularization
loss. In most cases, as it increases, the model’s performance
decreases gradually. This indicates that an excessively high
regularization strength can hinder representation learning. Sec-
ond, λ1 and λ2 control the trade-off between the two novel
modules in EDAD. They mutually learn different features in
the representations of time series. We observe that when the
weights of the two modules are approximately equal, the
model achieves the best performance in most cases. This is
evidence that the stable and auxiliary modules are equally
important and indispensable components of EDAD.
8) Effect of window size B: We study the effect of window
size B. More specifically, we vary B among 10, 25, 50,
100, and 200 to investigate the sensitivity to B. Figure 7
shows the experimental results. We observe that when B
increases, the model’s performance increases gradually and
becomes stable with B ≥50. In many cases, the model’s
performance achieves the peak with B = 100. Then, the
model’s performance starts to decrease with B > 100. This
observation aligns with existing studies [58], [75], where they
claim that deep anomaly detection methods frequently achieve
the best accuracy with B is set around 100.

inconsistent with the normal pattern of the entire time series. Seasonal anomalies refer to abnormalities in the seasonal pattern of the data.
Trend anomalies are patterns that contradict the long-term trend of a time series.

auxiliary features.
D. Visualization
In order to offer a more comprehensible and intuitive
illustration of how our method excels in detecting diverse
anomalies within time series data, we intentionally designed
and generated various types of anomaly sequences. The pri-
mary aim was to visually showcase the model’s proficiency
in identifying anomalies across different categories. Building
upon the categorization of anomaly types as summarized in
the work by Lai et al. [31], we subjected our method to the
assessment of five specific anomaly types: global, contextual,
shapelet, seasonal, and trend. Figure 8 visualizes the detection
results. While the figure is adapted from Lai et al., it accurately
reflects the characteristics observed by using our proposed
method, which is why we chose to include it. The results
demonstrate that our proposed framework can detect different
types of anomalies. This offers evidence of the effectiveness of
our approach and its capability to work on practical problems
where different anomaly types occur.
Next, we empirically analyze stable and auxiliary features
to further illustrate and understand their sensitivity. Figure 9
visualizes the distribution of stable and auxiliary features for

a toy dataset in two separate low-dimensional spaces using
t-SNE [67]. Note that we use the same axis scale for the
visualization of auxiliary features and the visualization of
stable features. It is clear that the distribution of auxiliary
features is more dispersed than that of stable features. Recall
that we use different strategies in the proposed stable module
and auxiliary module, which leads to different representations.
For stable features, we assume that the normal pattern in the
time series is persistent and is the normal form of the data,
so the distribution of stable features is relatively concentrated.
For auxiliary features, they contain noise and anomalies related
to timestamps, and this randomness results in the features
being relatively dispersed. Furthermore, Figure 10 illustrates
12
how the distributions of stable and auxiliary features evolve
across training epochs, again visualized with t-SNE. Initially,
the stable and auxiliary features exhibit similar distributions.
However, as the training progresses, the distinction between
these two feature types becomes increasingly pronounced. By
the final stages of training, the auxiliary feature representation
provides a clearer separation between normal instances and
anomalies, whereas the stable feature representation fails to
distinguish them.
V. RELATED WORK
Time Series Anomaly Detection. Many time series anomaly
detection approaches exist, including traditional statistical
methods, classical machine learning algorithms [14], [56],
and modern deep learning methods. Traditional statistical
methods detect anomalies by applying an auto-regression
mechanism [15], [20], [40]. These methods are easy to im-
plement and deploy. However, their accuracy is relatively
low. Classical machine algorithms can be categorized into
similarity-based and density-based methods. In similarity-
based methods, time series subsequences are compared. The
most different subsequences are likely to be anomalies. Senin
et al. [56] converted time series subsequences into characters
and used grammar rules to detect anomalies. In density-based
methods, time series subsequences are grouped into clusters.
Clusters with low density are then considered as anomalies.
Breunig et al. [14] propose Local Outlier Factor (LOF), which
considers the local density of clusters and is able to detect
local outliers effectively. Sequeira and Zaki [57] cluster time
series subsequences into a fixed number of clusters using a
k-medoids algorithm. Classical machine learning algorithms
do not consider time series-specific temporal information, so
they cannot be applied well in practical scenarios.
Deep learning based time series anomaly detection methods
are used widely in many applications such as object moni-
toring [80], network analysis [39], robotics [48], and human
behaviors analysis [28]. While diffusion-based models have re-
cently shown impressive performance for generative models in
terms of reconstruction quality, they are not intensively used in
time series anomaly detection, and they also incur substantial
computational costs. Crucially, our framework is orthogonal
to the backbone choice. Thus, the proposed Encode-then-
Decompose paradigm could be integrated with diffusion mod-
els. The latest methods include AnomalyTrans [76], which
measures the strength of correlations between observations
in time series, and DCdetector [77], which achieves im-
pressive performance using a contrastive learning approach
with a dual attention component. However, AnomalyTrans
and DCdetector do not perform the encode-then-decompose
mechanism like us. The most relevant study to our proposal is
Robust Autoencoders (RAEs) [81], which decomposes a dataset
into clean and anomalous components. The main difference
between RAEs and EDAD is that RAEs fail to handle temporal
information and thus cannot work on time series. Further,
RAEs decompose the data in the original space rather than
in the latent representation space, as EDAD does. EDAD also
integrates mutual information to better support decomposition.
To the best of our knowledge, EDAD is the first time series
anomaly detection method that decomposes the latent variable
to achieve robustness.
Mutual Information. Mutual information measures the re-
lationship between statistical variables. Mutual information
plays a role in many applications in a wide range of do-
mains. Early approaches typically use nonparametric models
for estimating mutual information [30], such as kernel density
estimation methods that use kernel functions to estimate the
probability density function of data. Deep neural networks and
representation learning [66] are being employed increasingly
for mutual information estimation to cater to the demands
posed by the expanding scale and complexity of contempo-
rary datasets, as well as the need for representation opti-
mization. Notable instances of this approach include Barber-
Agakov [6], mutual information neural estimator (MINE) [7],
and M-estimators [44]. Existing studies use mutual in-
formation to measure the relationship between variables in
supervised learning problems where labeled data is available.
To the best of our knowledge, our proposal is the first to
use mutual information for unsupervised time series anomaly
detection.
VI. CONCLUSION
We propose EDAD for unsupervised time series anomaly
detection. The framework addresses a key problem in
autoencoder-based anomaly detection methods: their high
vulnerability to contaminated training data. The framework
decomposes the latent representation into stable features and
auxiliary features that comprise long-term patterns and point-
wise patterns, respectively, rather than blindly reconstructing
the time series. A mutual information criterion is integrated
into the decomposition to support the robustness of the
framework. Experimental studies show that the framework is
effective and can outperform strong baselines and state-of-the-
art methods.
In future research, it is of interest to study anomaly detec-
tion in different settings, such as binary-value settings [77],
semi-supervised settings [35], time series of location-related
information [17], continual learning settings [73], and concept
drift settings [62], [69]. It is also of interest to study different
approaches such as ensemble learning [26] and explainabil-
ity [27] to further improve anomaly detection accuracy.
